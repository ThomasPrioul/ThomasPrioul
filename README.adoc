# Hello and welcome to my profile!

## About me

Here are some languages/techs I'm familiar with :

- *Web frontends (Angular/HTML/TailwindCSS/daisyUI/MaterialUI) : my current tech stack at work*.
- C# (.NET, WPF, Blazor) : my other well known stack, more for my legacy or CLI-only projects.
- Cross-language compatibility : I used to do a lot of this. Wrapping libs manually using P/Invoke with C#, or "automatically" using the (https://github.com/swig/swig)[SWIG] project to make python programs talk to a C++ library for example.
- C, C++ (for programming multicontrollers or similar environments) : I know what a pointer or a segfault is, however I haven't touched it for a long time.
- Qt : I did a bit of Qml for my end of studies project in the school year 2016-2017, https://github.com/ThomasPrioul/turntable)[you can about read it in my Turntable repository].

## Open-source portfolio

Here are some of my publicly available demo apps and libraries.

### https://github.com/ThomasPrioul/mdl-angular-libs[MDL angular lib]

The reusable angular components developed for my team at SNCF's Cluster Ingenierie Ouest (Tours - France).
It consists of a set of useful directives, but especially of my own flavor of Google's Material UI library, with CSS overrides to comply to SNCF's 2023/2024 design system.

### https://github.com/ThomasPrioul/CV[2018 CV as an app]

[%hardbreaks]
My 2018 CV as an executable app (single EXE file - unsigned so windows smartscreen will warn you).  
Made with C#/WPF.  
Uses custom Windows Shell integration, with a print button in the "system bar".  
Somewhat responsive to greater window sizes.
