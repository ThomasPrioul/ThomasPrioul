# Hello and welcome to my profile!

Here are some of my publicly available demo apps and libraries.

## https://github.com/ThomasPrioul/mdl-angular-libs[MDL angular lib]

The reusable angular components developed for my team at SNCF's Cluster Ingenierie Ouest (Tours - France).
It consists of a set of useful directives, but especially of my own flavor of Google's Material UI library, with CSS overrides to comply to SNCF's 2023/2024 design system.

## https://github.com/ThomasPrioul/CV[2018 CV as an app]

[%hardbreaks]
My 2018 CV as an executable app (single EXE file - unsigned so windows smartscreen will warn you).  
Made with C#/WPF.  
Uses custom Windows Shell integration, with a print button in the "system bar".  
Somewhat responsive to greater window sizes.
