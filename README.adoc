# Hello and welcome to my profile!

French developer living in Tours, France and working for https://masteris.com[MASTERIS], a subsidiary of SNCF dedicated to sharing SNCF's experience to other companies.

## About me

Here are some languages/techs I'm familiar with :

- French and English : I'm fluent in both, you can have me in your meeting, I won't embarass you, I promise.
- *Web frontends (Angular/HTML/TailwindCSS/daisyUI/MaterialUI) : my current tech stack at work*. I'm the go-to guy for all UI/UX/CSS questions at my office. See <<mdl angular lib>> below for reference.
- https://thingsboard.io[Thingsboard] and AWS : we use this kind of tech stack at MASTERIS as a base for rapid project prototyping and/or small projects.
- C# (.NET, WPF, Blazor) : my other well known stack, more for my legacy or CLI-only projects, I worked for 5+ years on all C# things, in pseudo realtime projects, involving custom networking over UDP.
- Cross-language compatibility : I used to do a lot of this. Wrapping libs manually using P/Invoke with C#, or "automatically" using the (https://github.com/swig/swig)[SWIG] project to make python programs talk to a C++ library for example.
- Docker, AWS, git, etc : I'm not a devops but I'll find my way around if needed.
- C, C++ (for programming multicontrollers or similar environments) : I know what a pointer or a segfault is, however I haven't touched it for a long time.
- Qt : I did a bit of Qml for my end of studies project in the school year 2016-2017, https://github.com/ThomasPrioul/turntable)[you can about read it in my Turntable repository].

## Closed-source portfolio

Here I will present some of my work for SNCF/Masteris (without disclosing anything sensible, of course).

### SNCF WPF theme

[%hardbreaks]
Custom theme made throughout my time as an apprentice at SNCF for my C# apps.
It ran fine on Windows XP!

## Open-source portfolio

Here are some of my publicly available demo apps and libraries.

### https://github.com/ThomasPrioul/mdl-angular-libs[MDL angular lib]

The reusable angular components developed for my team at SNCF's Cluster Ingenierie Ouest (Tours - France).
It consists of a set of useful directives, but especially of my own flavor of Google's Material UI library, with CSS overrides to comply to SNCF's 2023/2024 design system.

### https://github.com/ThomasPrioul/CV[2018 CV as an app]

[%hardbreaks]
My 2018 CV as an executable app (single EXE file - unsigned so windows smartscreen will warn you).  
Made with C#/WPF.  
Uses custom Windows Shell integration, with a print button in the "system bar".  
Somewhat responsive to greater window sizes.
